# 🎵 Lucas’s Recommended Recordings

Welcome to my personal guide to classical music — a curated collection of the recordings I return to most.

This site is the opposite of Apple Music Classical, which tries to list every existing recording of every classical work. I take a different approach: for each piece I love, I’ve chosen just one recording that I believe stands out — the version I recommend you actually listen to.

I usually prefer modern, high-resolution studio recordings over historic public performances. I’m not generally drawn to period instruments, though there are exceptions. Where possible, I’ve included links to the albums on Tidal (sorry, no Spotify).

Everything here reflects my personal taste, not any kind of critical consensus. If a piece is listed without a recording, I’m open to suggestions — feel free to share your favorites.
